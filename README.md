# Security Architecture

This is a useful tool designed to make on-premise provisioning much easier. It allows you to easily deploy security provisioned architectures in a kubernetes cluster.

This tool provides ease when deploying services, scaling them or monitoring them by providing a simple user interface. Meanwhile several machines are supplied to act as a gateway to our architecture, providing security by default.

## Requisitos

It is necessary to have kubernetes and minikube installed and the kubectl and minikube commands must be found in the PATH, since the platform makes use of these commands.

## Iniciar servidor
